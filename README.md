# Auditing Learning Circle

The Auditing Learning Circle meets weekly on Thursdays at 9:00 am Pacific / 2:00
pm Eastern / 5:00 pm Central European. Each week, we review the codebase of
a pre-audited, pre-mainnet Solidity project and try to find as many bugs,
vulnerabilities, exploits, and gas improvements as possible. During our weekly
meeting, we share everything we found and review the official audit report as
a group, going through anything that we missed.
